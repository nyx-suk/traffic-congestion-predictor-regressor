Traffic Congestion Predictor & Regressor
========================================

A research-based practice project for predicting traffic congestion using machine learning techniques. This project leverages both classification and regression models—Random Forest and Support Vector Regression (SVR)—to forecast congestion levels based on historical traffic data.

Overview
--------

This repository demonstrates an end-to-end workflow for building and evaluating machine learning models to predict traffic congestion. The primary goal is to explore how classification (Random Forest) and regression (SVR) algorithms perform on real-world traffic datasets.

Features
--------

*   Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis
    
*   Feature engineering for traffic datasets
    
*   Classification using Random Forest
    
*   Regression using Support Vector Regression (SVR)
    
*   Model evaluation and comparison
    
*   Jupyter Notebooks for step-by-step analysis
    

Data
----

The project uses publicly available traffic datasets. Details about data sources, preprocessing steps, and features are documented in the notebooks.

Getting Started
---------------

1.  bash
    

*   git clone https://github.com/nyx-suk/traffic-congestion-predictor-regressor.gitcd traffic-congestion-predictor-regressor
    
*   bash
    
*   pip install -r requirements.txt
    
*   bash
    

1.  jupyter notebook
    

Modeling Approach
-----------------

*   **Random Forest Classifier:** Used to classify congestion levels (e.g., low, medium, high).
    
*   **Support Vector Regression (SVR):** Used to predict continuous values related to congestion metrics.
    

Results
-------

Model performance is evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, F1-score (for classification), and RMSE (for regression). See the results and analysis in the provided notebooks.

Requirements
------------

*   Python 3.7+
    
*   Jupyter Notebook
    
*   scikit-learn
    
*   pandas
    
*   numpy
    
*   matplotlib
    
*   seaborn
    

(See requirements.txt for details.)

Usage
-----

*   Run the Jupyter Notebooks to follow the workflow.
    
*   Modify parameters or try different models to experiment with the data.
